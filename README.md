## Info
Flappy the crypto-bird needs to avoid malicious (hard)forks, but get GPU's to receive hash power ! Uh.. is that Pepe The Frog?. Avoid the SEC, they are always watching you.

## Controls
* click the mouse or tap (touch screen) to levitate or stop to descend. 
* If you hit the top or bottom boundaries you die.

## Features
* Based on the version control rules, the concepts incorporated are fork, branch, push, pull, clone associated with a crypto theme.
* Collisions are not super strict to make the gameplay a little less harder.

## About

There will be some obstacles along the way like forks, branches
and some enemies who are also known as "pakias". Hitting them
will end the game. 3 types of pakias - sad (pull you),
happy (push you), angry (kill you). Keep safe distance from
them!

There are some collectibles too! Coins for points (BTC for 50,
LTC for 100, ETH for 500, XMR for 1000). Stars for invincibility
for a short period. Berries spawning clones that'll destroy
anything that comes in their way!
